Introduction to Python

# Problem #2
Add 3 functions to the Python module created in Problem #1:

1. Function that subtracts two integers
1. Function that multiples two integers
1. Function that divides two integers

Your *functions* should use variables, but you can call them in your module with hard-coded values. It is expected from your module to be called via terminal and the output will be as follows:
```
$ python3 <script>.py
The result of 6 - 3 is 3.
The result of 6 x 3 is 18.
The result of 6 / 3 is 2.
```

# Problem #1
Create a Python module that implements a method that sums two variables and prints out the result in the following format:
```
The result of <A> + <B> is <C>.
```
This module should have instructions on how to run it and get the expected output. Please use Python 3.X.
